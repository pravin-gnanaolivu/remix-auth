# Remix Auth Example

![Remix Auth](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/The_Importance_of_User_Authentication_Methods_in_Cyber_Security.jpg)

**Remix Auth** Library is really coolðŸ˜Ž and easy to use. Here I'm adding an basic login to authenticate with remix-auth and signup form with validation using **remix-validation-form** to make validation easy.

I deployed this in vercel, you can use the below link

## Deployment

After having run the `create-remix` command and selected "Vercel" as a deployment target, you only need to [import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be deployed.

If you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can also deploy the directory by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

If you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's not needed.
